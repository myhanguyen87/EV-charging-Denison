# Charge Point Utilization
Denison University is committed to addressing climate change and recognizes the impact of vehicle operations on its carbon footprint. To align with sustainability goals, the university is establishing an electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure on campus, encouraging EV adoption. Challenges, such as charging time and network expansion, need to be addressed. Therefore, we, the DA301 "Charged" team, are committed to generating crucial insights that inform strategic decisions. Our primary objective is to provide the Campus Sustainability Committee with a comprehensive five-year plan outlining the effective implementation of electric vehicle (EV) chargers across Denison University's campus. This will be achieved through in-depth analyses of charger usage patterns, the identification of peak demand times, and the provision of recommendations aimed at enhancing usage efficiency.

### Motivation
Our primary motivation is to align with Denison University's sustainability goals. Denison is embarking on a journey to add more  electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructures on campus, a significant step towards encouraging the adoption of EVs among our community members. Therefore, our motivation is to drive Denison University towards a future where EVs play a central role in reducing our carbon footprint. With five chargers supporting the university's vehicle fleet transition to electric vehicles and facilitating personal electric vehicle usage for faculty, staff, and students, the project aims to explore potential opportunities and optimize charging strategies.
To be successful, we must have a clear understanding of EV user behavior and the flexibility to optimize infrastructure and policy. Our recommendations will be rooted in rigorous data insights, ensuring they reflect the real needs and potentialities of the University. Moreover, it is not just to provide EV charging but to transform Denison into a hub of sustainable mobility, making a positive impact on our community, environment, and the future of transportation.
